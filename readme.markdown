Social Network Exercise
=======

This is an exercise where I implement a simple social network.

See the specification.txt for details on the requested features.

It was build using Java 8 and Maven. Running 
```mvn install```
will produce a fresh executable jar (see below).

##Usage:

1. Make sure you have **access to Java 8** or higher with
```java -version```

2. **Run** the application from the command line via 
```java -jar social-network-exercise-jar-with-dependencies.jar```

3. Use an empty line to **quit** the application

4. Use the following **commands** to interact with the application:

**posting**:
```<user name> -> <message>```

**reading**:
```<user name>```

**following**: 
```<user name> follows <another user>```

**wall**: 
```<user name> wall```
