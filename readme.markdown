Social Network Exercise
=======

This is an exercise where I implement a simple social network. See the specification.txt for details on the requested features.

Usage:
1. **Run** the application from the main in StartApp.java
2. Use an empty line to **quit** the application
3. Use the following **commands** to interact with the application:
 * **posting**: *<user name> -> <message>*
 * **reading**: *<user name>*
 * **following**: *<user name> follows <another user>*
 * **wall**: *<user name> wall*
